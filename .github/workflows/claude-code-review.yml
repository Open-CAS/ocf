            Review this pull request as a senior C kernel engineer familiar with the OCF codebase.

            Focus on:
            - Memory safety and undefined behavior
            - Race conditions and locking correctness
            - ABI compatibility and API stability
            - Adherence to Linux kernel coding style
            - Performance implications
            - Correctness of cache metadata and IO path changes

            Be specific with file:line references. Flag critical issues clearly.
